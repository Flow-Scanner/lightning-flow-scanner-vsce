## Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate!

### :beetle: Issues
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.
If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. 
If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/RubenHalman/Force-Flow-Control/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A PR is a way to suggest changes in our repository. Make sure you get assigned to a ticket describing those changes, before starting a PR. 
When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:
