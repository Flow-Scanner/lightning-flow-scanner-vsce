# Run Automated Jobs on Salesforce Flow(s) using Visual Studio Code

## Introduction

**Force Flow Control** 
*Aims to assist you when you work with Salesforce Flows(force.com platform automation tools) using the Visual Studio Code Editor,
offering you automated jobs for otherwise time consuming tasks.*

*We recommend you combine this tool in combination with SFDX, but it is not a prerequisite and it is possible to use the extension locally.*

## Using the commands

Open the **Command Palette** and type `flow` to see the list of available commands.

### Clean Flow
