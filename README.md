## Introduction

**Force Flow Control** aims to add development support for Salesforce Flows, providing features such as _merge flows_ or _rename flows_, etc. 

## Installation

## Using the commands

Open the **Command Palette** and type `flow control` to see the list of available commands.

### Merge Flows

The flows must therefore have a common point of intersection such as a decision as shown in the example below.
